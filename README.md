# gumdrop

gameboy gogo

This is a gameboy emulator written in C++. Yeah!

## Build

You can probably just do `./buildmii.sh` and it'll build everything for you. If you want to do it manually, you can do the following:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./bin/gumdrop
```

## Some Notes

I don't know what I'm doing, so I'm happy to merge PRs or otherwise take suggestions that would improve this!

This is mostly an exercise on how to learn more about low-level hardware and C++.

## Special Thanks

Thanks to Allie for everything, as always!
